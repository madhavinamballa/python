# Write a class named Car that has the following 
    *   data attributes:

        • year_model (for the car’s year model)
        • make (for the make of the car)
        • speed (for the car’s current speed)

    *   methods:

        • accelerate
        • brake
        • get_speed
    
    *   The Car class should have an _ _init_ _ method that accepts the car’s year model and make as arguments. These values should be assigned to the object’s year_model and make
    data attributes. It should also assign 0 to the speed data attribute.

    *   Next, design a program that creates a Car object and then calls the accelerate method   five times. After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and display it. Then call the brake method five times. After each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
